            removed the man's rectal temperature was 106.3 which was three or four hours after the malarial paroxysm. Members of this man's family were infected with malaria, and he was not well and had been advised to take treatment, which he ignored. He
            admitted that he had been tortured the night before by the turpentine saturated string. Proper treatment for malaria promptly controlled the situation. U.S. rural South. Early 20th century.</text>

          <text>Chinese ivory figurine from the interior of China, obtained by Miss Mary Cutter from a Chinese physician. It was used for women patients in this manner: Modesty on part of the patient and custom forbade a personal examination; so the patient

          <text>Korean herb doctor's drugs. Note: The drugs described on the following cards are used by Korean herb doctors. Besides regular medical doctors, there are two types of herb doctors in Korea. The older type, which still flourishes in rural areas,
            is learned through an apprenticeship. The modern type, which is licensed by the government, requires a student, who has attained the equivalent of a high school education, to study pharmacology in an institution. Largely, herbal medicine is taught
            there, but western pharmacology is taught also. It appears that the herbal medicines in this collection derive from the old-type of herb doctor. These Korean herbal medicines come in their original paper bags, and are imprinted with their names in
            Chinese characters. The herb medicines were introduced from China and retain their Chinese names. The small paper envelopes, imprinted with Korean characters, were merely used as containers for the want of others: they derive from the Graham
            Tuberculosis Sanatorium (Korean name: Kwang Ju Chai Joong). The drugs are not from the hospital.</text>
