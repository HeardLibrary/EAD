          <unittitle>Korean herb doctor's drugs. Note: The drugs described on the following cards are used by Korean herb doctors. Besides regular medical doctors, there are two types of herb doctors in Korea. The older type, which still flourishes in rural
            areas, is learned through an apprenticeship. The modern type, which is licensed by the government, requires a student, who has attained the equivalent of a high school education, to study pharmacology in an institution. Largely, herbal medicine is
            taught there, but western pharmacology is taught also. It appears that the herbal medicines in this collection derive from the old-type of herb doctor. These Korean herbal medicines come in their original paper bags, and are imprinted with their
            names in Chinese characters. The herb medicines were introduced from China and retain their Chinese names. The small paper envelopes, imprinted with Korean characters, were merely used as containers for the want of others: they derive from the Graham
            Tuberculosis Sanatorium (Korean name: Kwang Ju Chai Joong). The drugs are not from the hospital.</unittitle>
