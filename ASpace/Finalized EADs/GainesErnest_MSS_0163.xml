      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Ernest J. Gaines, a prominent African-American writer was born on January 15, 1933. He grew up in the slave quarters of a plantation in Pointe Coupee, Louisiana, a place which had an important influence on his fiction. He received his early
        education there in a schoolroom in a plantation church. When he was fifteen he moved to Vallejo, California to live with his mother and step-father. When he was seventeen he wrote his first novel. It was rejected by a publisher. He later rewrote it
        and published it as
        <emph render="italic">Catherine Carmier</emph>.</p>
      <p>He served with the Army for two years and won a writing fellowship to Stanford University. Among his many published works are his novels
        <emph render="italic">The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1971); A Lesson Before Dying (1993); and In My Father&#8217;s House (1978)</emph>. Several of his works have been made into film, most notably the television version of
        <emph render="italic">The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman</emph>
        which aired in 1974. Gaines has received many honors and awards for his work.</p>
      <p>Since 1984 he divides his time between San Francisco and Lafayette, Louisiana where he teaches a creative writing workshop every fall at the University of Louisiana.</p>
