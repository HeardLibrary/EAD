        in Nashville until the Civil War began. During the war, he served as a captain in the Third Tennessee Regiment, Confederate Army, and as Adjutant General on the staff of General John C. Brown. Wilkes married Florence A. Barker on June 20, 1865 and
        soon after the war entered into the practice of law. One of his law partners was his former commander, John C. Brown and, upon Brown's election as governor, Wilkes again served him in the capacity of Adjutant General. In 1892 Wilkes was appointed
        Supreme Court Judge of Tennessee to finish out the unexpired term of Judge Peter Turney, who was elected governor of the state. Judge Wilkes served on the bench from 1892 to 1908, being re-elected several times. He had an excellent reputation for
