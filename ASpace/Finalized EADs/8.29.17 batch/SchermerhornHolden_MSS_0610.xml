      <p>Holden Bovie Schermerhorn (1868-1935) was born in Massachusetts. He held PH.B, and LL.B degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, and a LL.M from Temple University of Philadelphia. In 1916, he came to Vanderbilt University as a Professor of Law
        and with the exception of two years he remained at Vanderbilt in that capacity until his death. And, from 1925-1935 he served as Secretary of the Law School.</p>
      <p>From 1918-1920 he was with the Paris branch of Coudert Brothers, one of the largest law firms in the world, with headquarters in New York. While in Paris both during and after the war, he dealt with the many problems of private international law.</p>
      <p>Professor Schermerhorn had many interests. He was proficient in art, music, acting, and wrote many articles for journals, and was the author of several books on Torts Law and the Tennessee Parthenon. Although he never took art lessons he was a
        good artist. Most of his sketches were done in pencil, and the subjects being old buildings and streets in Paris, and later sketches of Vanderbilt University&#8217;s College Hall, done in pencil on ordinary photograph mount.</p>
