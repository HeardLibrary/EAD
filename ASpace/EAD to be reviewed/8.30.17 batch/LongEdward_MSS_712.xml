<unittitle>Misc. clippings, mostly from &#8216;80s and &#8216;90s fairly thoroughly filed by subject (in file folders), with many coming from &#8220;alternative weeklies&#8221;, and some from daily papers and mainstream magazines. Little (if any) of it relates directly to Long himself.</unittitle>

<unittitle>Some topics:</unittitle>

<note>
<p>Politics and news (many sub-topics with separate folders), music, humor, Nashville, and a collection of the weekly syndicated &#8220;News of the Weird.&#8220;</p>
</note>

<c01 level="item">
<did>
<container type="box">3</container>
<unittitle>There are a <emph render="italic">lot</emph> of clippings in some of these folders, some quite small. If he only wanted one paragraph he often just cut out the one paragraph, so many of the folders are overflowing with small bits of paper.</unittitle>

<container type="box">4</container>
<unittitle>My subjective take on these first four boxes: There&#8217;s an incredible amount of raw material for anyone interested in political or cultural subjects from the 80s-90s, with a slant towards the left-wing, countercultural, and just plain quirky.</unittitle>
</did>
</c01>
<c01 level="item">
<did>
<container type="box">5</container>
<unittitle>Contains a folder with 3 &#189; issues (out of 5 total?) of the 1970 <emph render="italic">Nashville Breakdown</emph> &#8220;underground&#8221; paper which Long was involved in.</unittitle>
</did>
</c01>
<c01 level="item">
<did>
<container type="box">5</container>
<unittitle>There is another (large) folder of copies of <title render="italic">Common Ground</title> from 1990-91, a progressive and community oriented paper (monthly?) with both a national staff and a local one; the content is a mixture of local and national stories.</unittitle>
</did>
</c01>
<c01 level="item">
<did>
<container type="box">5</container>
<unittitle>The remainder of the box (about 80%) is a collection of comic strips cut out and filed in folders by name; some of these are fairly mainstream strips from daily papers, some are from &#8220;alternative&#8221; papers. There are maybe 25 different comics in all?</unittitle>

<container type="box">6</container>
<unittitle>This box consists of various political papers and clippings, mostly from the 1970s, filed by subject.</unittitle>
</did>
</c01>
<c01 level="item">

<container type="box">6</container>
<unittitle>There is a folder on the Southern Student Organizing Committee with personal letters and documents. This also includes a transcription of Long&#8217;s interview with Gregg Michel, for Michel&#8217;s doctoral dissertation on the SSOC, which was published as &#8220;Struggle for a Better South&#8221; in 2004.</unittitle>

<unittitle>This box contains press clippings on the &#8220;Nashville Movement&#8221; filed by year, from 2001-2006.</unittitle>

<unittitle>It also contains folders of various community newsletters and papers from the era, in full.</unittitle>

<c01 level="item">

<container type="box">9</container>
<unittitle>This box contains full manuscripts (copied) of various books (and dissertations), none written by Long as far as I could tell.</unittitle>
</did>
</c01>
<c01 level="item">
<did>
<container type="box">9</container>
<unittitle>There is also one large box (200 pages?) of meticulously copied press clippings. I did not get into it enough to be able to describe the contents, but did wonder if this might be Long&#8217;s own compiling of some of his material from the rest of the collection. It seems to me this would be well worth further investigation.</unittitle>
