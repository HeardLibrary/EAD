        <emph render="bold">John Crowe Ransom</emph>
        noted poet, critic, educator and editor was born April 30, 1888 in Pulaski, Tennessee. He graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1909, was a Rhodes Scholar at Christ Church, Oxford, 1910-1913, and joined the Faculty at Vanderbilt in 1914, where he
        taught English until 1937. While at Vanderbilt, Ransom was a major figure in both the Fugitive and Agrarian groups. He published in the
        <emph render="italic">Fugitive</emph>
        magazine (1922-1925) and contributed the introduction &#8220;A Statement of Principles&#8221; and the initial essay &#8220;Reconstructed but Unregenerate&#8221; for
        <emph render="italic">I&#8217;ll Take My Stand</emph>. In 1937 Ransom accepted a position at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio as Carnegie Professor of Poetry. While at Kenyon he founded and edited an important literary quarterly,
        <emph render="italic">The Kenyon Review</emph>
        (1939-1959). His works of poetry include
        <emph render="italic">Poems About God</emph>
        (1919),
        <emph render="italic">Chills and Fever</emph>
        (1924), and
        <emph render="italic">Selected Poems</emph>
        (1945, 1963, 1969). Among the many honors and awards he received were the Bollingen Award in 1951 and the National Book Award for poetry in 1963. There are a number of books written about him and his poetry including Thomas Daniel Young&#8217;s
        biography
        <emph render="italic">Gentleman in a Dustcoat</emph>
        (1976) He died in 1974 at the age of eighty six. This collection is a record of his correspondence with the poet and novelist Robert Graves.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Robert Graves</emph>
        poet, novelist, and scholar was born July 24, 1895 in Wimbledon, Surrey, England. He was educated at Charterhouse School and was offered a scholarship at St. John&#8217;s College at Oxford, which he declined and soon after joined the the Royal Welch
        Fusiliers to fight in the first World War. During that time he befriended and defended fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon. Graves was seriously injured at the Battle of the Somme(1916) and presumed dead. He recovered and went on to have a long life and
        literary career, publishing poetry and novels and works of scholarship. He was married twice (to Nancy Nicholson and Beryl Hodge ) and had eight children, and some of his personal life was unorthodox, including his relationship with Fugitive poet
        Laura Riding. Together they published with their Seizin Press two important academic books:
        <emph render="italic">A Survey of Modernist Poetry (1927) and A Pamphlet against Anthologies (1928)</emph>. Graves also published several books which remain highly regarded:
        <emph render="italic">I Claudius (1934); The White Goddess(1948); and The Greek Myths (1955)</emph>
        among others.. Graves always considered himself a poet first and foremost. He died on December 7, 1985 at the age of ninety, and is buried in Majorca beside his wife Beryl in a small churchyard overlooking the sea. The correspondence in this
        collection is from John Crowe Ransom to Robert Graves with accompanying poems and newspaper reviews.</p>
