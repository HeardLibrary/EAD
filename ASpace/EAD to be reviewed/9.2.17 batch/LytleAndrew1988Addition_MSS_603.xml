<p>The Papers of Andrew Nelson Lytle (1902-1995), author, educator, editor, critic and Vanderbilt University alumnus (B.A. 1925), were acquired in 1988 from Mr. Lytle. A preliminary organization was performed on the collection in 1988, but until now had not been fully processed. This collection consists of copied material and is valued for its informational content such as extensive letters from Lytle&#8217;s wife, Edna Langdon Barker Lytle. Included within this collection is correspondence, writings, writings about Lytle, family documents, and financial documents.</p>
<p>For details of Lytle&#8217;s life and works, the following are recommended:</p>

<note>
<p>The Correspondence Series is contained in 2 boxes of this collection. The series is subdivided into Outgoing (1937&#8211;1958) and Incoming (1922&#8211;1988).</p>
<p>The Outgoing Correspondence is comprised of 71 letters that are arranged chronologically. The date of the postmark was used when a letter was undated. The majority of outgoing correspondence is to Lytle&#8217;s wife, Edna Langdon Barker Lytle. There are three undated outgoing letters without postmarked envelopes.</p>
<p>The Incoming Correspondence is made up of 582 letters and is arranged alphabetically by correspondent. Letters were arranged chronologically when more than one letter of a correspondent was present. As with the outgoing correspondence, the incoming correspondence used the postmark date of the envelope if the letter was undated. The affiliation of the correspondent is noted in parenthesis. Bracketed information indicates either to whom the correspondence is directed if other than Andrew Lytle or gives additional details about the correspondence. Dates are inclusive dates of the correspondence. There are several letters from Edna Langdon Barker Lytle, Andrew&#8217;s wife.</p>
