<p>During the 1960s she was active in the Civil Rights Movement and directed the Springfield Urban League&#8217;s Leadership Development Project. Through her participation in the National Council of Negro Women, she helped welfare mothers obtain college scholarships to continue their education and pursue professional careers.</p>
<p>Carol was the first woman elected to the Board of Directors of Wilberforce University and the first African-American woman to serve on the Board of Directors of Banc Ohio National Bank and later, National City Bank. She has held leadership positions with numerous community organizations and has been the recipient of a multitude of awards.
