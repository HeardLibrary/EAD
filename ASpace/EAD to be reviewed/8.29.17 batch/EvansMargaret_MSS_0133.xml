<head>Biography:</head>
<p>Dr. Margaret Evans, 1891-1981, was the first practicing psychoanalyst in Tennessee. She began her practice at Vanderbilt University with Dr. William Orr in 1957, and worked primarily at training the psychiatric department staff in work with disturbed children.</p>
<p>Dr. Evans was born in Bath, England in 1891 and maintained her British citizenship. She was trained initially in social work and graduated from University of London with honors.</p>
<p>In 1914 she went to India for her health and lived there for five years. During that time, she taught at Calcutta, and one of her students was former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>
<p>During her work in Australia, she isolated an insect that had been causing destruction of cotton crops in northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>She returned to the United States in 1954, and that year and the next worked at Western Reserve University in Cleveland.</p>
