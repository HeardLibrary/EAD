      <head>Biography of Jesse Lee Cuninggim</head>
      <p>Jesse Lee Cuninggim was born in 1870 in North Carolina. Cuninggim was the last president of Scarritt Bible and Training School and the first president of Scarritt College. Scarritt Bible and Training School was originally for young women training
        to be missionaries. Scarritt Bible and Training School was formerly based in Kansas City, Missouri and was affiliated with the United Methodist Church. This school was credited for starting to train deaconesses in 1902.</p>
      <p>When Jesse L.Cuninggim came into the position of president of Scarritt Bible and Training School, his intention was to move the school from Kansas City and enlarge the school&#8217;s academic focus. In 1924 the school was moved to Nashville,
        Tennessee and was renamed Scarritt College.</p>
      <p>Jesse L. Cuninggim did his theological studies at Vanderbilt University. Cuninggim, at one point, was also the Director of the Department of Ministerial Supply and Training at Vanderbilt University.</p>
