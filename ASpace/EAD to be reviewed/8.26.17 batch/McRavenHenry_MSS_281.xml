<head>Biography</head>
<p>These papers were donated to the Vanderbilt University Special Collections and Archives by William Henry McRaven, noted author from Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Mr. McRaven, son of John and Lula McRaven, was native to Yazoo, Miss. and completed his education in the Mississippi school system. He then moved to Dallas, TX where he was employed by the Federal Reserve Bank for 11 years. In 1923 he married Miss Annie Terrell. The couple moved to Nashville in 1934 where Mr. McRaven was employed by the Internal Revenue Service for 10 years. He then acted as secretary-treasurer for a southern pipe-line construction company. His book about one of Nashville&#8217;s founders, &#8220;The Life and Times of Edward Swanson&#8221; was authored and published in 1937. In 1949, his book on the history of Nashville, &#8220;Nashville&#8211;Athens of the South,&#8220; was published. Copies of both books are in the Heard Library.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Henry McRaven Papers are comprised of 6 folders of typescript on onionskin paper. The first folder contains lists of Nashville officials including Chamber of Commerce Presidents (1869-1947), Mayors (1806-1947), and Postmasters (1796-1947). The remaining folders contain accounts compiled from various newspapers by Mr. McRaven of Presidents&#8217; visits to Nashville. An account exists for Presidents McKinley, F.D. Roosevelt, T. Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson. While there were no dates presented for the collection, the most likely dates were from around 1934, when he moved to Nashville, to 1947, the latest date on the list of officials.</p>
