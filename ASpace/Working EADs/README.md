# Working EAD Documents
This document details the EAD finding aids that are unable to be imported into ArchivesSpace in their current form. Where available, it also contains the issues that each individual xml doc has and what steps need to be taken to repair. As documents are repaired, they will be removed from this list and added to the Finalized EAD folder.

## LawsonJames (MSS.0626)
This collection is currently in the middle of processing. This finding aid was produced from an early 2017 version of the inventory, but it is still unclear if this is the current structure. Work has been paused on this project until the status can be determined, or until the collection is fully processed.

## McGawRobert Maps (MSS.0274)

## McTyeireGarland (MSS.0284)
It is unclear if this is actually a collection that is different from MSS 282 or MSS 283. This 2 page inventory is also contained in MSS.0282's finding aid. While this is being determined, work has been ceased on this doc. If resumed, fixing this doc would simply entail doing some find and replace regexes on the <table> elements to make it look like EAD elements. This is a short document.
